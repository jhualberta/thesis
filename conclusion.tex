In this thesis, a reconstruction algorithm framework was developed for multiple SNO+ physics phases. It achieves position resolutions for 300~mm in the water phase and 70 mm in scintillator phase, with small biases within 100 mm. This framework has been applied for the SNO+ water phase and partial-fill phase analysis. 

By looking at the low background dataset for 190.33 live days, a $^8$B solar neutrino rate of $ \pm~events/(kt\cdot day)$ with a background rate of $ \pm $ $events/(kt\cdot day)$ in the energy region [5,15] MeV were obtained. This result gives an estimated $^8$B solar neutrino flux $\mathrm{\Phi_{^8B}=(4.48 \pm 0.44(stats.)^{+0.13}_{-0.08}(syst.))\times10^6~cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$. The elastic scattering in this energy region is $\mathrm{\Phi_{ES}=(2.07 \pm 0.20(stats.)^{+0.12}_{-0.11}(syst.))\times10^6~cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$. These results are consistent with the SNO+ 2018 measurement\cite{anderson2019measurement} and the Super-K 2016 measurement\cite{abe2016solar}.
