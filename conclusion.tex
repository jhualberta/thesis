In this thesis, a reconstruction algorithm framework was developed for multiple SNO+ physics phases. It achieves position resolutions for 300~mm in the water phase and 70 mm in scintillator phase, with small biases within 100 mm. This framework has been applied for the SNO+ water phase and partial-fill phase analysis. 

By looking at the low background dataset (run-200001 to 207718) for 190.33 live days, a $^8B$ solar neutrino rate of $119.40\pm11.84$ $events/kt$ with a background rate of $36.55\pm7.57$ $events/kt$ in the energy region [5,15] MeV were obtained. This result gives an estimated $^8$B solar neutrino flux $\Phi_{^8B}=(4.48 \pm 0.44(stats.)^{+0.13}_{-0.08}(syst.))\times10^6~cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. The elastic scattering in this energy region is $\Phi_{ES}=(2.09 \pm 0.20(stats.)^{+0.06}_{-0.03}(stats.))\times10^6~cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. These results are consistent with the SNO+ 2018 measurement\cite{anderson2019measurement} and the Super-K 2016 measurement\cite{abe2016solar}.
