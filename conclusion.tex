In this thesis, a reconstruction algorithm framework was developed for multiple SNO+ physics phases. For the SNO+ detector with a diameter of 12 m, it achieves position resolutions of 300~mm for the water phase and 70 mm for scintillator phase. The position biases are within 100 mm for both phases. This framework has been applied to the SNO+ water phase and partial-fill phase analysis. 

By utilizing the water phase reconstruction, this thesis provides an alternative analysis for the $^8$B solar neutrino measurement during the SNO+ water phase. By looking at the low background dataset for 190.33 live days, a $^8$B solar neutrino rate of $0.90\pm0.09~events/(kt\cdot day)$ with a background rate of $0.29\pm 0.06$ $events/(kt\cdot day)$ in the energy region [5,15] MeV were obtained. As the energy threshold is pushed down to 5 MeV, this background rate is significantly low for the solar neutrino measurement in a water Cherenkov detector.

The result also gives an estimated $^8$B solar neutrino flux as: 

$\Phi_{\mathrm{^8B}}=(4.62 \pm 0.459 (stats.)^{+0.126}_{-0.104}(syst.))\times10^6$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, 
while the elastic scattering is measured as: 

$\Phi_{\mathrm{ES}}=(2.07 \pm 0.206(stats.)^{+0.0527}_{-0.0454}(syst.))\times10^6$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$.
