In this thesis, a reconstruction algorithm framework (the Multi-Path Fitter) was developed for multiple SNO+ physics phases. For the SNO+ detector with a diameter of 12 m, it achieves position resolutions of 300~mm for the water phase and 70 mm for scintillator phase. The position biases are within 100 mm for both phases. This framework has been applied to the SNO+ water phase and partial-fill phase analysis. This thesis uses the fitter for analyzing the $^8$B solar neutrinos during the SNO+ water phase. The fitter was also used by the SNO+ collaboration as the prime vertex fitter for the physics analyses during the partial-fill phase, and it has potentials to be used in the scintillator phase and tellurium phase.

For the water phase, the reconstruction uncertainties in event position and energy were determined by analyzing the data and simulations of $^{16}$N source calibrations. For a fiducial volume of 5.5 m, the position biases between the data and simulations in the $(x,y,z)$ axes are all within $\pm10$ mm; the fractional energy scale uncertainty is $1.0$\%, and the fractional uncertainty on the energy resolution at kinetic energy $T_e$ is $0.037\sqrt{T_e/\mathrm{MeV}}$.

By utilizing the water phase reconstruction, this thesis provides an alternative analysis for the $^8$B solar neutrino measurement during the SNO+ water phase. By looking at the low background dataset for 190.33 live days, a $^8$B solar neutrino rate of $0.90\pm0.09$~events/(kt$\cdot$day) with a background rate of $0.29\pm 0.06$ events/(kt$\cdot$day) in the energy region [5,15] MeV were obtained. As the energy threshold is pushed down to 5 MeV, this background rate is significantly low for the solar neutrino measurement in a water Cherenkov detector.

The result also gives an estimated $^8$B solar neutrino flux as: 

$\Phi_{\mathrm{^8B}}=(4.62 \pm 0.459 (stats.)^{+0.126}_{-0.105}(syst.))\times10^6$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, 
while the elastic scattering flux is measured as: 

$\Phi_{\mathrm{ES}}=(2.07 \pm 0.206(stats.)^{+0.0528}_{-0.0455}(syst.))\times10^6$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$.

The $\Phi_{\mathrm{ES}}$ result given here is consistent with the recent measurements from the Super-Kamiokande and Borexino experiments.
