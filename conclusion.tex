In this thesis, a reconstruction algorithm framework was developed for multiple SNO+ physics phases. For the SNO+ detector with a diameter of 12 m, it achieves position resolutions of 300~mm for the water phase and 70 mm for scintillator phase. The position biases are within 100 mm for both phases. This framework has been applied to the SNO+ water phase and partial-fill phase analysis. 

By utilizing the water phase reconstruction, this thesis provides an alternative analysis for the $^8$B solar neutrino measurement during the SNO+ water phase. By looking at the low background dataset for 190.33 live days, a $^8$B solar neutrino rate of $ \pm~events/(kt\cdot day)$ with a background rate of $ \pm $ $events/(kt\cdot day)$ in the energy region [5,15] MeV were obtained. For the energy threshold down to 5 MeV, this background rate is significantly low for the water Cherenkov detector.

The result also gives an estimated $^8$B solar neutrino flux as:

$\mathrm{\Phi_{^8B}=(4.48 \pm 0.44(stats.)^{+0.13}_{-0.08}(syst.))\times10^6~cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$, 

while the elastic scattering is measured as:

 $\mathrm{\Phi_{ES}=(2.07 \pm 0.20(stats.)^{+0.12}_{-0.11}(syst.))\times10^6~cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$.
 
 These results are consistent with the SNO+ 2018 measurement\cite{anderson2019measurement} and the Super-K 2016 measurement\cite{abe2016solar}.
