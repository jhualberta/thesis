In this thesis, a reconstruction algorithm framework was developed for multiple SNO+ physics phases. 

This framework was used in the SNO+ water phase as an event vertex-direction fitter 

Especially for the water phase, to analyze solar neutrino fluxes.

By looking at the low background dataset (run-200001 to 207718) for 190.33 live days, a $^8B$ solar neutrino rate of $119.40\pm11.84$ $events/kt$ with a background rate of $36.55\pm7.57$ $events/kt$ in the energy region [5,15] MeV were obtained. This result gives an estimated $^8$B solar neutrino flux $\Phi_{^8B}=(4.48 \pm 0.44(stats.))\times10^6~cm^{-2}s^{-1}\times(syst.)$. The elastic scattering in this energy region is $\Phi_{ES}=(2.09 \pm 0.20(stats.)\times(stats.))\times10^6~cm^{-2}s^{-1}$.
