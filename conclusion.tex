In this thesis, a reconstruction algorithm framework was developed for multiple SNO+ physics phases. This framework was used in the SNO+ water phase as an event vertex-direction fitter to analyze solar neutrino fluxes.

By looking at the low background dataset (run-200001 to 207718), a $^8B$ solar neutrino rate of $119.40\pm11.84$ $events/(kt\cdot day)$ with a background rate of $36.55\pm7.57$ $events/(kt\cdot day)$ in the energy region [5,15] MeV are obtained. This result gives an estimated solar neutrino flux.
