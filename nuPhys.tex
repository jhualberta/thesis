\section{Neutrino Flavor Transformation and Oscillation}

Neutrino oscillation was first discovered in 1998.
It is the first direct evidence showing that the Standard Model is incomplete. 

The neutrinos generated with definite flavor from weak interactions and related to 




solar neutrino oscillations

\subsection{Vacuum Oscillation}



\subsection{Matter Effect}

The matter effect is caused by neutrinos interacting with ambient electrons and nucleons in matter such as the Sun or the Earth. $\nu_e$ interacts with electrons via both charged weak current (exchanging $W$ boson) and neutral weak current ($Z$ boson) while $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ interact only by the neutral current. The $\nu_e$ energy has an addition term, $V_{CC} =\sqrt2G_Fn_e$, where $n_e$ is the number density of the electrons in matter and $G_F$ is the Fermi coupling constant for the weak interaction. This affects the oscillation probabilities for neutrinos propagating in matter compared to vacuum, which is called the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) mechanism\cite{smirnov2016solar,smirnov2005msw}.

In vacuum two-flavor mixing, the Schr\"{o}dinger equation can be written (in natural units)\cite{xing2011neutrinos}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2flavor_simple}
	i\frac{d}{dt}\begin{bmatrix}
		\nu_e\\
		\nu_\mu\\
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	H^f_0
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\nu_e\\
		\nu_\mu\\
	\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
where 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:H0f}
\begin{aligned}
 H^f_0 = \frac{1}{2E}\begin{bmatrix}m^2_1\cos^2\theta+m^2_2\sin^2\theta & (m^2_2-m^2_1)\sin\theta\cos\theta \\ (m^2_2-m^2_1)\sin\theta\cos\theta & m^2_1\sin2\theta+m^2_2\cos^2\theta\end{bmatrix} =
\\
\frac{\Delta m_{21}^2}{4E}\begin{bmatrix}
	-\cos 2\theta & \sin 2\theta\\
	\sin 2\theta & \cos 2\theta\\
\end{bmatrix}+\frac{(m_1^2+m_2^2)}{4E}\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0\\
	0 &1\\
\end{bmatrix},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
and $\Delta m^2_{21}=(m^2_2 - m^2_1)$.

To simplify the calculation, we can drop the second unitary term of $H^f_0$ that is irrelevant to the neutrino flavor transformation. Including the matter effect, we obtain:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Hm}
	H_m = \begin{bmatrix}
		-\frac{\Delta m_{21}^2}{4E}\cos 2\theta+\sqrt 2G_Fn_e & \frac{\Delta m_{21}^2}{4E}\sin 2\theta\\
		\frac{\Delta m_{21}^2}{4E}\sin 2\theta &\frac{\Delta m_{21}^2}{4E}\cos 2\theta\\
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

We define a mixing angle in matter, $\theta_m$ as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:thetaM}
	\tan 2\theta_m = \frac{\Delta m^2\sin2\theta}{\Delta m^2\cos2\theta-2\sqrt 2E G_Fn_e},
\end{equation}
and define an effective squared-mass difference in matter $\Delta m^2_m$ as:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta m^2_m = \sqrt{(\Delta m^2\cos2\theta - 2\sqrt 2EG_Fn_e)^2+(\Delta m^2\sin2\theta)^2}.
\end{equation}

In analogy with mixing in vacuum, we can write the mixing equation relating the energy eigenstates in matter ($\nu_{1m},\nu_{2m}$) to the flavor eigenstates with a diagonalized Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:matter_mixing}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\nu_e\\
		\nu_\mu\\
	\end{bmatrix}
	= \begin{bmatrix}
		\cos\theta_m & \sin\theta_m\\
		-\sin\theta_m & \cos\theta_m \\
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\nu_{1m}\\
		\nu_{2m}\\
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

The probability of flavor transformation in matter is:
\begin{equation}
	P_{\nu_e\to\nu_{\mu}}=\sin^2(2\theta_m)\sin^2\Big(\frac{\Delta m_m^2L}{4E}\Big).
\end{equation}

The denominator in equation (\ref{eq:thetaM}) implies a resonance condition:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:reson_condition}
	V(n_e)=\sqrt 2G_Fn_e=\frac{\Delta m^2\cos2\theta}{2E}.
\end{equation}

From this condition, for a given $E$, there is a resonance density $n^{reson}_e$ while for a given $n_e$, there is a resonance energy $E^{reson}$. When the resonance condition is satisfied, $\theta_m = \frac{\pi}{4}$ and two flavor neutrinos are maximally mixed, even if the vacuum mixing angle $\theta$ is small. This is called matter enhanced neutrino oscillation\cite{smirnov2016solar,fukugita2013physics}.

\subsection{Three-flavor Mixing}

For three-flavor neutrino mixing, we have\cite{pdg2018}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mixingmatrix}
|\nu_f> = \sum_{k=1}^3U^*_{fk}|\nu_k>, 
\end{equation}
where $f=e,\mu,\tau$ and $k=1,2,3$. The unitary PMNS matrix, $U_{PMNS}$, can be parametrized as: 

$U_{PMNS} = $
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &0 &0\\
0 &\cos\theta_{23} &\sin\theta_{23}\\
0 &-\sin\theta_{23} &\cos\theta_{23}\\ 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta_{13} &0 &e^{-i\delta_{CP}}\sin\theta_{13}\\
0 &1 &0\\
e^{-i\delta_{CP}}\sin\theta_{13} &0 &\cos\theta_{13}\\ 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta_{12} &\sin\theta_{12} &0\\
-\sin\theta_{12} &\cos\theta_{12} &0\\
0 &0 &1\\ 
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}




In the PMNS matrix, we have four parameters: the three mixing angles $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$ and the charge-parity (CP) violation parameter of lepton sector, $\delta_{CP}$. The unknown value of $\delta_{CP}$ is related to leptogenesis, the hypothetical physical process that produced an asymmetry between leptons and antileptons in the very early universe\cite{wiki_cp}. In addition, there are two squared-mass differences, $\Delta m^2_{21}=m_2^2-m_1^2$ and $\Delta m^2_{32}=|m_3^2-m_2^2|$. The sign of $\Delta m^2_{32}$ is unknown and it indicates a mass hierarchy problem of whether neutrino mass is normal hierarchy (NH, $m_3>m_2>m_1$) or inverted hierarchy (IH, $m_3<m_1<m_2$)\cite{pdg2018}. 

Currently, these six parameters have been measured by neutrino oscillation experiments. These experiments can be classified by the neutrino sources they use. They are the solar, the reactor, the atmospheric, the accelerator and the astronomical neutrino experiments. Table~\ref{nu_exp} lists the energy scale of the neutrino source as well as the example experiments.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\caption{\label{nu_exp} Oscillation neutrino experiments.}	
	{\centering
		\begin{tabular*}{135mm}{c@{\extracolsep{\fill}}cccc}
			\toprule

			accelerator&  $\nu$ beam from accelerator & GeV scale & T2K\\	
			astronomical& astronomical objects & GeV-EeV scale & IceCube\\	
			\bottomrule	
		\end{tabular*}
	}
\end{table}

For the $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\theta_{12}$, the combined analysis of the measurements from the reactor experiment KamLAND and SNO gave $\Delta m^2_{21} = 7.59^{+0.21}_{-0.21}\times 10^{-5}eV^2$ and $\tan^2{\theta}_{21}=0.47^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$\cite{kamland_measure}.

The accelerator neutrino experiments as well as the atmospheric neutrino experiments have measured $\Delta m^2_{32}$ and $\theta_{23}$. The most recent results from SuperK show that in NH, $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.588^{+0.031}_{-0.064}$ and $\Delta m^2_{32} = 2.5^{+0.13}_{-0.20}\times 10^{-3} eV^2$\cite{superk_new}. 

In 2012, the reactor neutrino experiment Daya Bay reported the discovery of non-zero $\theta_{13}$ with a significance of 5.2$\sigma$. In 2016, Daya Bay reported that $\sin^2 2\theta_{13} = 0.0841\pm0.0027(stat.)\pm0.0019(syst.)$. This high-precision result makes $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$ the best measured mixing angle\cite{dayabayresults,reactorNu}.

$\delta_{CP}$ is examined by the experiments which measure the difference between neutrino and antineutrino oscillation probabilities $P(\bar{\nu}_\alpha\to\bar{\nu}_\beta)$ and $P(\nu_\alpha\to\nu_\beta)$\cite{xing}. In 2017, the T2K experiment in Japan rejected the hypothesis that neutrinos and antineutrinos oscillate with the same probability at 95\% confidence (2$\sigma$) level. This indicates a hint of CP symmetry broken by neutrinos\cite{t2k}.


The oscillation probability in matter can be written in a concise and exact form as \cite{kimura2002exact}:
\[
P(\nu_e\to\nu_\mu) = A\cos\delta+B\sin\delta+C
\]



will also provide the information for the CP- and T-violation
by investigating the quantities of:
\[
A_{CP} = \frac{P(\nu_\alpha\to\nu_\beta)-P(\bar{\nu}_\alpha\to\bar{\nu}_\beta)}{P(\nu_\alpha\to\nu_\beta)+P(\bar{\nu}_\alpha\to\bar{\nu}_\beta)}
\]

\[
A_T = \frac{P(\nu_\alpha\to\nu_\beta)-P(\bar{\nu}_\beta\to\bar{\nu}_\alpha)}{P(\nu_\alpha\to\nu_\beta)+P(\bar{\nu}_\beta\to\bar{\nu}_\alpha)}
\]

\section{Majorana Neutrino}

Dirac equation $(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m)\psi=0$,
get coupled equations


The interpretation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ process is considered as exchanging light Majorana neutrinos. In this case the effective Majorana mass $<m_{ee}>=\sum_{i=1}^{3} |U_{ei}|^2m_i~(i=1,2,3)$, where $U_{ei}$ are the elements of the neutrino mixing matrix for the flavor state $\nu_e$, and $m_i$ are the mass eigenvalues of the mass eigenstates (from (\ref{eq:mixingmatrix})). The observable quantity is the half-life:
\[
(T^{0\nu\beta\beta}_{1/2})^{-1} = G_{PS}(Q,Z)|M_{Nuclear}|^2<m_{ee}>^2, 
\]



Majorana found a representation of the $\gamma$-matrices as follow:
\[
\gamma_M^0 = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & \sigma^2 \\
\sigma^2 & 0
\end{pmatrix},
\gamma_M^1 = \begin{pmatrix} 
\sigma^3 & 0 \\
0 & \sigma^3
\end{pmatrix},
\gamma_M^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 
-\sigma^2 & 0 \\
0 & \sigma^2
\end{pmatrix},
\gamma_M^3 = -i\begin{pmatrix} 
\sigma^1 & 0 \\
0 & \sigma^1
\end{pmatrix}
\]


These matrices themselves are pure imaginary. 


\section{Double Beta Decay}

For heavy radioactive isotopes with nuclei of even neutron number (N) and even proton number (Z) (called even-even nucleus), beta decay will lead to an odd-odd nucleus which is less stable. For some such isotopes the beta decay is energetically forbidden. In 1935, Maria Goeppert-Mayer pointed out that they can still decay through a double beta decay process: $(Z,A) \to (Z+2,A)+2e^{-}+2\bar{\nu_e}+Q_{\beta\beta}$, where the $Q_{\beta\beta}$ is the released energy. This is called ordinary double beta decay or $2\nu\beta\beta$, which is allowed by the Standard Model and with a typical half-life $T_{1/2}>10^{19}$ years\cite{martin}.

In 1937, Ettore Majorana proposed that neutral spin-1/2 particles (fermions) can be their own antiparticles\cite{majorana}. If neutrinos have this behaviour, the process called neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) will also be expected. The Feynman diagrams of $2\nu\beta\beta$ and $0\nu\beta\beta$ are illustrated in Figure~\ref{feynman1}.

%\end{figure}

The interpretation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ process is considered as exchanging light Majorana neutrinos. In this case the effective Majorana mass $<m_{ee}>=\sum_{i=1}^{3} |U_{ei}|^2m_i~(i=1,2,3)$, $U_{ei}$ are the elements of the neutrino mixing matrix for the flavor state $\nu_e$, and $m_i$ are the mass eigenvalues of the mass eigenstates (from (\ref{eq:mixingmatrix})). The observable quantity is the half-life:
\[
(T^{0\nu\beta\beta}_{1/2})^{-1} = G_{PS}(Q,Z)|M_{Nuclear}|^2<m_{ee}>^2, 
\]
where $G_{PS}$ is the phase space factor and $|M_{Nuclear}|$ is the nuclear matrix element for the physics process describing the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay process\cite{kaizuber}.

Similar to beta decay, the $2\nu\beta\beta$ process will cause a continuous spectrum in the detector while the $0\nu\beta\beta$ process only has two electrons in the final state, which sum up to give a distinct energy peak. By measuring this exact energy, a detector with high energy resolution is able to search for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ signal from the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay radioactive isotopes. Diverse technologies have been developed during the past decades. The following section lists some of the mainstream experiments.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:majoranaField}
\Psi_R=\begin{bmatrix}
\psi_R\\
\psi_R^C\\
\end{bmatrix},
\Psi_L=\begin{bmatrix}
\psi_L\\
\psi_L^C\\
\end{bmatrix},
M=\begin{bmatrix}
m_L^M &  m^D\\
m^D &  m_R^M\\
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
%
The mass eigenstates:
\[
m_{\pm} = \frac{1}{2}[~(m_L^M+m_R^M)\pm\sqrt{(m_L^M-m_R^M)^2+4(m^D)^2}~]\label{eq:majorana_massEigen},
\]
from (\ref{eq:majorana_massEigen}), there are 4 cases for discussion:\\
(1) If $m_L^M=m_R^M=0$, $m_{1,2}=m^D$, neutrinos are pure Dirac particles.\\
(2) If $m^D\gg m^M_{L,R}$, $\frac{m^D}{m_{L,R}^M}\to 0$, $m_{1,2}=\frac{1}{2}m^D[~\frac{(m_L^M+m_R^M)}{m^D}+\sqrt{(\frac{m^M_L-m^M_R}{m^D})^2+4}~]\approx m^D$, neutrinos are Pseudo-Dirac-Neutrinos.
\\
(3) If $m^D=0$, $m_1=m^M_L, m_2=m^M_R$, neutrinos are pure Majorana particles.\\
(4) In the case of the seesaw mechanism, where $m_R^M\gg m^D, m_L^M=0$,
and for $(\frac{m^D}{m_R^M})^2\to 0$, use $(1+x)^\alpha\sim 1+\alpha x ~~(~if~x\to 0~)$, we get:
\[
m_1=m_-=\frac{\frac{1}{2}[(m^M_R)^2-(m^M_R)^2-4(m^D)^2]}{m_R^M(1+\sqrt{1+4(\frac{m^D}{m^M_R})^2})}\approx -\frac{(m^D)^2}{m^M_R},
\]

\[
m_2=m_+=\frac{1}{2}[m^M_R+m^M_R(1+\frac{1}{2}(\frac{2m^D}{m^M_R})^2)]=m^M_R[1+(\frac{m^D}{m^M_R})^2]\approx m^M_R.
\]


For $\mathcal{O}(1TeV)$, the $\nu$ mass is $0.1~eV$






\subsection{Status of Double Beta Decay Experiments}

At the time of writing, 

$0\nu\beta\beta$ in the range of $10^{25}-10^{26}$ year,




The GERmanium Detector Array (GERDA) experiment searches for $0\nu\beta\beta$ of $^{76}$Ge. The experiment uses bare germanium crystals with an enrichment of up to $\sim$87\% $^{76}$Ge operated in a radiopure cryogenic liquid argon (LAr). GERDA Phase I had an exposure of 21.6 kg$\cdot$yr and Phase-II started with 35.6kg from enriched material in December 2015. With combined data of Phase I and Phase II, 

a total exposure of 82.4 kg$\cdot$yr 



GERDA reported in 2019 a lower limit half-life of $T^{0\nu}_{1/2}(^{76}$Ge$)>0.9\times 10^{26}$ years at 90\% C.L.\cite{gerda,agostini2019probing}.




The Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO) experiment uses 200-kg liquid Xenon (LXe) time projection chamber (TPC) to search for $0\nu\beta\beta$ in $^{136}$Xe. In 2011 they observed the half life of double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe to be $2.11\times 10^{21}$ years and in 2014 they set a limit on $T^{0\nu}_{1/2}(^{136}$Xe$)>1.1\times 10^{25}$ yr\cite{exo}. EXO is now upgrading to the next 5-tonne experiment (nEXO) and is expected to reach an exclusion sensitivity of $T^{0\nu}_{1/2}(^{136}$Xe) to about $10^{28}$ years at 90\% C.L.\cite{nEXO}.

Also looking into $^{136}$Xe, the KamLAND-Zen (ZEroNeutrino) experiment exploits the existing facilities of KamLAND by setting a 3.08-m-diameter spherical inner balloon filled with 13 tons of Xe-loaded liquid scintillator at the center of the KamLAND detector.

liquid scintillator cocktail of 82\% decane and 18\% pseudocumene by volume, 2.7 g/L PPO.

photocathode coverage of 34\%.

 Their 2016 results from a 504 kg$\cdot$yr exposure obtained a lower limit for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay half-life of $T^{0\nu}_{1/2}(^{136}$Xe$)>1.07\times 10^{26}$ yr at 90\% C.L. and the corresponding upper limits on the effective Majorana neutrino mass are in the range $61-165$ meV\cite{kamlandZen}.

high pressure gas-phase time projection chamber (TPC)  




The Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events (CUORE) experiment searches for $0\nu\beta\beta$ in $^{130}$Te. CUORE is a ton-scale cryogenic bolometer array that arranges 988 tellurium dioxide (TeO$_2$) crystals. CUORE reported first results in 2017 after a total TeO$_2$ exposure of 86.3 kg$\cdot$yr. An effective energy resolution of ($7.7\pm 0.5$) keV FWHM and a background count of ($0.014\pm0.002$) counts/(keVkgyr) in the ROI were achieved in that data exposure. Combined with the early data (the data from the two precursor experiments, Cuoricino and CUORE-0), they placed a lower limit of $T^{0\nu}_{1/2}(^{130}$Te$)>1.5\times 10^{25}$ yr at 90\% C.L. and $m_{\beta\beta}<(110-520)$  meV\cite{alduino2018first}. In five years live time, the experiment will give a projected sensitivity of $9.5\times 10^{25}$ yr at the 90\% C.L. and set an upper limit on the effective Majorana mass in the range $50-130$ meV\cite{piperno2015dark}.
