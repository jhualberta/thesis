### Evaluating $^8$B Solar Neutrino Flux

A software called PSelmaa (Physics interpretation Sun-Earth Large Mixing Angle Adiabatic
Approximation) was implemented in RAT\cite{fady_pselmaa}. The software uses the BS05(OP) SSM model  and it assumes the normal mass hierarchy. It also applies the MSW effects from the Sun (see Chapter 2) but neglects the MSW effects from the Earth (i.e., the regeneration of coherence in the Earth). Fig.~\ref{fig:pselmaa_curves} shows the survival probability curve as a function of energies (in 0.1 MeV intervals) taken from the PSelmaa.

Fig.~\ref{fig:pselmaa_curves}. The MSW survival probability curves. The $P_{ee}$ is in solid red line and $P_{e\alpha}(=1-P_{ee})$ is in green dashed line.

In the RAT MC simulations, to gain more statistics, the solar $\nu_e$ events is generated by 1700 times the nominal ($flux~scale = \frac{1}{1700}$); while the solar $\nu_\mu$ events is generated by 9600 times the nominal ($flux~scale=\frac{1}{9600}$). Since it is impossible for the SNO+ detector to discriminate between $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ via detecting the elastic scattering events, $\nu_\tau$ is not generated separately. Therefore, the generated solar $\nu_\mu$ events are considered as a combination of $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ ($\nu_\mu\approx\nu_{\mu,\tau}$) in the solar neutrino flux. In addition, to compare the MC with the data, a live time scale was taken into accounts: $t_{frac}=\frac{t_{data~live~time}}{t_{MC~run~time}}=\frac{190.33~days}{198.17~days} = 0.96$.

The MC generated $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ were first both scaled by the $t_{frac}$ and $flux~scale$. To obtain the oscillated histograms, each $ \nu_e$ ($\nu_\mu$) event was weighted by the oscillation probability $P_{ee}$ ( $P_{e\alpha}=1-P_{ee}$) according to PSelmaa curve with respect to the MC energy of that event. Finally, applying these weighting parameters as well as the BDT cuts on the MC histograms, Fig.~\ref{fig:MCfluxPdfs} shows the MC $\cos\theta_{sun}$ distributions as $pdf$s in the energy region $5<E_{fit}<15~MeV$ with and without oscillations.

Fig.~\ref{fig:MCfluxPdfs}. The MC $\cos\theta_{sun}$ distributions used as $pdf$s for the flux calculations, for $5<E_{fit}<15~MeV$ after the BDT cuts. The histogram in black is the $\nu_e$ flux without oscillation, referring to $pdf(\nu_e,without~oscillation)$. This histogram is used for fitting the elastic scattering flux. The dashed red histogram is the $\nu_e$ flux and the dashed green shaded histogram is the $\nu_\mu$ flux, both including the oscillation. These two histograms were combined to form the blue histogram as the total flux including the oscillation, referring to $pdf(\nu_e+\nu_\mu,oscillated)$, which is used for fitting the total flux.

Reading from the above histograms, the expected event number for $\nu_e$ without the oscillation is $N_{\nu_e} = 322.69$ while including the oscillations, the expected event number for $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ are $N^{osci}_{\nu_e} = 113.58$ and $N^{osci}_{\nu_\mu} = 32.64$ respectively, and the combined event number is $N^{osci}_{\nu_e+\nu_\mu}=146.22$.

To fit for the total $^8$B neutrino flux, the fit parameter here is the flux scale $f_s$, which is interpreted as the fraction of the observed $^8$B flux to the expected flux. Using the same method in Section \ref{sect:poisson_fit}, and in the Equation: 

$$-2\ln\mathcal \lambda(N_{sig},N_{bkg})
=2\sum_{i=0}^{N_{bins}}[\mu_i(N_{sig},N_{bkg})-n_i+n_i\ln\frac{n_i}{\mu_i(N_{sig},N_{bkg})}]$$, 

replacing the $N_{sig}$ with $N_{sig}=f_s\cdot N^{osci}_{\nu_e+\nu_\mu}(=146.22)$, and then fitting the $N_{sig}$ and the $N_{bkg}$ with the $pdf(\nu_e+\nu_\mu,oscillated)$. The fit results are $f_s=0.82\pm 0.08$ (corresponding to $N_{sig}=119.35\pm11.70$ events) and $N_{bkg}=36.64\pm7.55$ events, with a p-value = 0.0714. The fit result is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:TOTALfluxFit}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:TOTALfluxFit}. The gray histogram is the $pdf(\nu_e+\nu_\mu,with~oscillations)$, the distribution of $\nu_e$ flux without oscillation. The black dots are the data points and the blue histogram is the fitted ES flux.

Thus, with the nominal $^8$B solar neutrino flux $\Phi^{total}_{MC}=5.46\times 10^6~cm^{-2}s^{-1}$, the observed total flux is evaluated as:

$$\Phi^{total}_{fit}(^8 B)=f_s\cdot \Phi^{total}_{MC}=(4.48\pm 0.44(stats.))\times 10^6~cm^{-2}s^{-1}.$$

To fit for the $^8$B flux corresponding to an observed flux of ES interactions, the same procedure was used, while the fit parameter was changed to $N_{sig}=f_s\cdot N_{\nu_e}(=322.69)$ and the $pdf$ was changed to $pdf(\nu_e,without~oscillation)$. The fit results are $f_s=0.369\pm 0.036$ (corresponding to $N_{sig}=119.07\pm11.62$ events) and $N_{bkg}=36.81\pm 7.56$ events, with a p-value = 0.0704. The fit result is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ESfluxFit}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:ESfluxFit}. The gray histogram is the $pdf(\nu_e,without~oscillation)$, i.e., the distribution of $\nu_e$ flux without oscillation. The black dots are the data points and the blue histogram is the fitted ES flux.

Thus, for the nominal $^8$B solar neutrino flux, the observed ES flux was evaluated as:

$$\Phi_{ES}=f_s\cdot \Phi^{total}_{MC}=(2.01\pm 0.20(stats.))\times 10^6~cm^{-2}s^{-1}.$$


This value can be compared to the Super-K measurement: $\Phi_{ES}=(2.345\pm0.039)\times 10^6~cm^{-2}s^{-1}$ and the SNO+ 2018 published results: $\Phi_{ES}=2.53^{+0.31}_{-0.28}(stat.)^{+0.13}_{-0.10}(syst.)\times 10^6~cm^{-2}s^{-1}$.
