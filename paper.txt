the $\nu_e$ in the $0\nu\beta\beta$ process has a non-zero effective Majorana mass

underlying mechanims 

the u, d quarks and the electron are massive
the Standard Model left-handed interaction $\bar{\nu}_{eL}\gamma_\mu e_L+\bar{u}_L\gamma_\mu d_L}W^\mu$ exists

the Black Box theorem relates the effective Majorana neutrino mass with the $0\nu\beta\beta$ amplitude <m_\nu>, or the Majorana property of the $\nu_e$ with the existence of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ process. 


the See-saw mechanism explains the smallness of neutrino masses compared to the other fermions in the Standard Model.
