% It takes several years for this thesis to come out, and it cannot be there without the supports from numerous people. First, I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Aksel Hallin. As an experienced experimental physicist, he is unique in mastering the art of particle physics experiments, and is always on the front line of the research, which amazes people. He is a great teacher with insights and patience. Thanks to Dr. Carsten B. Krauss, who provided me critical suggestions for my researches and also a chance for working in the laboratory. Thanks to Dr. Juan Pablo Ya\~{n}ez Garza, who shared his smart suggestions for the physics analysis, and extensive knowledge in neutrinos.

% The fellow researchers, postdocs and staffs in the Department of Physics at the University of Alberta gave me a lot of helps during my phD study. I would like to thank Dr. Kalpana Singh, Dr. David Auty, Dr. Karin Gilje, Dr. Yang Zhang, Dr. Fady Shaker, and Dr. Munish Sharma. We worked together for SNO+, and I got a few helps and suggestions from them. A special thank to Kalpana, who gave me a hand when I first involved in the SNO+ researches. With patience, she taught me a lot of research methods, and shared her smart ideas on resolving problems. Karin and David kindly helped me a lot in the experiment, analyses and academic English writing. I had a wonderful travel to the Sudbury with David for my first summer visit in SNOLAB. Prof. John Wilson offered me a lot of helps in my thesis writing, and I am also amazed by his great and pure enthusiasm in physics after his retirement. %I woulld like to thank Dr. Richard Soluk, Paul Davis and Len Wampler for their helps in the laboratory. Thanks to Suzette Chan, Sarah Derr, Rae Beaumount, Dr. Erik Rosolowsky and Dr. Craig Heinke who gave me useful helps during my PhD program.%

%I would like to thank my office mates: Logan Sibley, Pawel Mekarski, Thomas McElroy, Courtney Mielnichuk, Joseph Willis, Jonathan Chalaturnyk and Pooja Nolan. I spent wonderful time with these smart and interesting persons, who have great ethusiasms for science and life. Logan and Pawel were my co-workers in SNO+. They kindly helped me to get familiar with the collaboration and the SNO+ research work, as well as enjoying the life in Edmonton.
