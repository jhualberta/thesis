% Thanks to my friends: Dr. Lingjun Zhou, Haifeng Xu, Wenhui Ruan, doctor Youfang Luo, Jinyuan Luo, Yuxiu Lv, Wenqing Yu, Dinglian Kang and Jingyan Hao. They have brought me countless interesting insights and ideas about science as well as the life. ``A fine example has boundless power.'' Among these wonderful friends, Youfang works hard as a doctor and takes great care of her patients through day to night. Similiarly, her younger brother, Jinyuan, as a research scientist in engineering, takes every minutes during the daytime for thinking and working in his field. I am astounded and deeply touched by their diligence and positive attitudes towards the work and life.
