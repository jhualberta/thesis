As a multi-purpose experiment, SNO+ can also measure neutrinos from the Sun, reactors and earth. It has measured the high energy components of the neutrinos from the Sun, or solar neutrinos along with an extremely low backgrounds. It will measure the low energy component of the solar neutrinos.


Neutrinos are the only known fermions among the elementary particles in the Standard Model. They only undergo via weak interaction and gravity. 

In the Standard Model, leptons are described in the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ group theory.
$(\nu_e,e),(\nu_\mu,\mu),(\nu_\tau,\tau)$
the left- and right-handed isospin groups
the third component

$I_3=\frac{1}{2},Q=-1$

the left-handed leptons form doublets while the right-handed leptons are in singlets.
Gell-Mannâ€“Nishijima formula $Q=I_3+\frac{1}{2}Y$, where the hypercharge $Y$ is a sum of the and the strangeness (the number of s-quark)

$Y=(b+S)$
