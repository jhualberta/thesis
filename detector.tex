\section{A Description of SNO+ Detector}

\subsection{Overview}
The SNO+ experiment is located at SNOLAB in Vale's Creighton mine in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The deep underground facility of the SNOLAB provides a $2092\pm6$ m flat overburden of rock, which is $5890\pm94$ water equivalent meter (w.e.m). This rock overburden ensures an extremely low rate of cosmic muons passing through the detector. The rate is $0.27~\mu/m^2/day$, compared to an average flux of about $1.44\times 10^6~\mu/m^2/day$ at sea level\cite{muonflux}.

The detector has been running since December 2016\cite{ndpaper},


The SNO+ detector is the successor of the SNO experiment, which makes use of the SNO detector structure. 


detector consists of an acrylic vessel (AV) sphere of 12 m in diameter and

5.5 cm in thickness. The AV sphere is concentric within a stainless steel photomultiplier(PMT) support structure (PSUP), which is a geodesic dome with an average radius of 8.4 m. The Hamamatsu 8-inch R1408 PMTs are mounted on the PSUP. 9394 PMTs are looking inward to the AV, giving a 50\% effective coverage, while 90 PMTs are looking outward, serving as muon vetos. These two structures are housed in a rock cavity filled with 7000 tonnes of ultrapure water (UPW) to provide both buoyancy for the vessel and radiation shielding.

\subsection{SNO+ Physics Phases}
The SNO+ detector is designed for multi-purpose measurements of neutrino physics.
The experiment will go through three phases\cite{whitepaper}: 

1. Water phase 

The AV was filled with about 905 tonnes of ultra pure water (UPW). The detector has been collecting physics data since May 2017.

The main physics goal in this phase is to search for the invisible nucleon decay, which violates baryon number and is a prediction of Grand Unified Theory (GUT). In this decay mode, $^{16}$O decays into $^{15}$O$^*$ or $ ^{15}$O$^*$, which de-excites and produces a $\gamma$ ray of about 6 MeV.

During the water phase, different types of calibration runs have been taken. The detector responses, systematics and backgrounds are studied. Multiple physics analyses of solar neutrinos, reactor antineutrinos and nucleon decay are going on. The external backgrounds are also measured, which will be the same as the following two phases. 

2. Scintillator phase

The AV will be filled with 780 tonnes of liquid scintillator, which is a mixture of linear alkylbenzene (LAB) as a solvent and 2 g/L of 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO) as a fluor.

In this phase, the main physics goal is to measure low energy solar neutrinos: the CNO, pep and low energy $^8$B neutrinos. The pep neutrinos are mono-energetic, with $E_\nu$=1.442 MeV and their flux is well predicted by the Standard Solar Model. A measurement of the pep neutrinos will give more information of the matter effects in neutrino oscillations\cite{borexino}. 

The solar metallicity is the abundance of elements heavier than $^4$He (called ``metal'' elements in the context of astronomy). It is poorly constrained and the predictions from different solar models disagree with each other. A measurement of the CNO neutrinos can give the abundance of $^{12}$C, $^{13}$N and $^{15}$O and can thus resolve the metallicity problem\cite{cno}.

Geoneutrino, reactor antineutrino and supernova neutrino detections are additional goals.

A six-month period of scintillator filling and six to twelve months of data-taking are expected for this phase. During the filling, it is planned to operate the partially filled detector at a water level about 4.4 m for about two weeks. This partial filled transition phase is mainly aimed to understand the in-situ backgrounds of scintillator. 

3. Tellurium loading phase

In this final phase, 0.5\% natural Tellurium by mass will be loaded into the scintillator.
Higher loading concentrations would be possible for a further loading plan\cite{Paton:2019kgy}.
 The $^{130}$Te is a double beta decay isotope. The main purpose in this phase is searching for $0\nu\beta\beta$ in $^{130}$Te.


\subsection{Detection Principle}

\subsubsection{Optical Cherenkov Radiation Detection}
In the SNO+ water phase, the relay on the .

For any charged particle travelling in a transparent medium at an ultrarelativistic speed (a speed greater than the local phase speed of light in the medium), there is an electromagnetic radiation emitted from the medium under the action of the field of the moving particle\cite{landau2013electrodynamics}.


\[v>v_p=c/n(\omega)\]   $\cos\theta_c = (1/n\beta)$


where c is the speed of light in vacuum, n is the refraction index of the medium and $v=\beta c$ is the speed of the particle in the medium.


Frank-Tamm formula

For a particle with a charge of $ze$, the number of photons produced by Cherenkov radiation per unit path lenght and per unit energy interval of the photons is described by :
 
\[
\frac{d^2N_r}{dEdx}=\frac{\alpha^2 Z^2}{\hbar c}\mu(E)(1-\frac{1}{\beta^2 n(E)^2})
\]

where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant



For the case of $e^-$ travelling in the water, we can find that 0.262 MeV is the lowest kinetic energy to create Cherenkov radiation, which is called the Cherenkov threshold.

\subsubsection{Scintillation Detection}

prompt emission of scintillation light, which is called fluorescence
delayed emission of scintillation light, which is called delayed fluorescence or phosphorescence.

\subsection{Electronics}

The SNO+ electronics system includes trigger and readout systems, which record the time and charge information of PMT signals. The system can measure signals with a nanosecond-level timing resolution and single-photon level charge resolution and handle a rate of several kHz for normal operations.

\section{Monte Carlo Simulation for SNO+}
The SNO+ collaboration has developed a software framework, called the Reactor Analysis
Tool (RAT), which integrates a Monte Carlo simulation of the SNO+ detector and event-based analysis tools (for online and offline event analysis) since the beginning of the program. This software was originally developed by Stan Seibert for Braidwood Collaboration for a generic KamLAND like detector. It is also used by the other astroparticle physics experiemnts, such as DEAP/CLEAN, CLEAR and potentially for Darkside-50.







Geant4 Toolkit and
incorporates ROOT libraries for data handling and analysis.



The RAT Monte Carlo was originally developed for the Braidwood Collaboration
utilising software developed for a generic KamLAND like detector, called Generic Liquid Scintillator GEANT4 simulation (GLG4). It was branched and
developed into the specialist SNO+ version, starting in 2006/2007.

GLG4sim


Braidwood






 combines both Monte Carlo simulation of the Braidwood detector with event-based analysis tasks, like reconstruction. The primary goals are:

Make it easy to analyze Monte Carlo-generated events as well as data from disk using the same software with only a few command changes. Even in the proposal R\&D phase, where there is no real data, this is still useful for dumping Monte Carlo events to disk to be analyzed by another job. When there is real data, being able to do the analysis with the same code path as was used on Monte Carlo is very reassuring.
Allow for a modular, user-controlled analysis of events. This includes allowing the user to selected which analysis tasks to perform (different fitters, pruning unneeded data from the event data structure, etc.). It should also be relatively straightforward for users to introduce their own code into the analysis process.
Separate analysis into small tasks which can be developed asynchronously by different people, yet integrated with minimal (or perhaps zero) pain.
Integrate into existing GEANT4 and GLG4sim efforts with a minimum of code duplication. As much as possible, RAT should be designed incorporate upgrades of these packages just by relinking. No cut and paste of code (mainly a question with GLG4sim).
