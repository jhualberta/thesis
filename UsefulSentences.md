Whether $m_3>m_2$ (normal hierarchy) or $m_3<m_1$ (inverted hierarchy), that is still an unsolved problem.

“source=detector” configuration

the double $\beta$ decay nuclei are part of the detector, say,  ingredients of the detection medium.

this allows to install a large target mass

There are 35 isotopes can go through double $\beta$ decay process. However, only 11 of these isotopes are good experimental candidates since they can release a Q-value larger than 2 MeV for detection. For these 11 isotopes, most of them have been observed with normal double $\beta$ decay signals.

Currently, the search for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ is the only way to check the Majorana character of neutrinos as well as the existence of lepton number violation.

















The external background consists of $\gamma$s coming from the high radioactive content of the PMTs and acrylic,     $^{208}$Tl;       natural radioactive isotopes present in the external water.   has the strong radial dependency . Largely reduced by fiducialization and can be further controlled by the study of sideband control samples at large radius

detector scalability is a critical feature of the SNO+. Tellurium can be loaded at larger concentrations beyond 0.5\%

an increased amount of Tellurium and an optimized liquid scintillator enhance scintillation light yield

**Cherenkov**

an electromagnetic shock wave is created

the coherent wavefront formed is conical in shape and is emitted at a well-defined angle cos… with respect to the trajectory of the particle.

this angle is dependent on the speed of the particle and the frequency of the emitted radiation

$\frac{d^2 E}{d\omega d\Omega}=z^2 \frac{\alpha\hbar}{c}\sin^2\theta |\frac{\omega L}{2\pi\beta c}\frac{\sin\xi(\theta)}{\xi(\theta)}|^2$

$\xi(\theta) = \frac{\omega L}{2\beta c}(1-\beta n \cos\theta)$

$(\sin\xi/\xi)^2$ is Fraunhofer diffraction.

Cherenkov radiation is thus emitted in a pattern similar to diffraction, that is with a large peak centered at $\cos\theta = 1/(\beta n)$ followed by smaller maxima.

For L large compared to the wavelength of the emitted radiation, the  $(\sin\xi/\xi)$ term approaches the delta function $\delta(1-\beta n \cos\theta)$

$\frac{dN}{dx} = 2\pi z^2 \alpha \sin^2\theta_C \int_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2}\frac{d\lambda}{\lambda^2}$ = 475 $z^2\sin^2\theta_C~photons/cm$
