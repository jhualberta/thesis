Neutrinos are one of the elementary particles we currently know and are included in the Standard Model (SM). However, some properties of neutrinos can not be described by the SM, which shows clues of the new physics beyond the SM.


SNO+ is a multi-purpose neutrino experiment


SNO+ experiment is planned to explore one of the unknown properties of neutrinos: whether the neutrinos are Majorana particles or Dirac particles.


In this thesis, a position and time reconstruction algorithm is developed for SNO+ physics phases.
