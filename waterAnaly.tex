%\epigraph{There is an art in the contemplation of water. It is necessary to look at it as foaming in waves.}{--- \textup{Mencius}, \textit{\\translated by James Legge}}

The SNO+ water phase data were taken from May 2017 to September 2018. The period from May 2017 to October 2018 is the first stage of the water phase. During this stage, several calibration runs were taken, including the $^{16}$N calibration scans and the laserball scans. During the period from October 2018 to July 2019, over 20 tonnes of LAB (without PPO) was filled into the detector and the LAB mostly occupied the neck volume, slightly below the neck bottom. With the nitrogen cover gas on the top of the AV, the dataset taken during this period is called ``low background dataset''. 

In this chapter, I applied the MPW reconstruction algorithm mentioned in Chapter 4 as a position and direction fitter to the raw dataset as well as the run-by-run MC simulations. The fitted event vertex was used by the energy fitter developed by the SNO+ collaboration.  

I mainly analyzed the low background dataset.

\section{High Level Cuts: Classifiers}

A set of classifiers were developed by SNO analysis and been optimized for the SNO+ water analysis\cite{highlevel}.

valid reconstruction


These classifiers utilize the reconstructed quantities

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\bullet$] In time ratio (ITR) classifier

For each event, this classifier loops the triggered PMTs (hits), calculates the $t_{res}$ and then finds the ratio of the number of hits in an optimized prompt time window. In the water phase, it checked 

[-2.5,5.0]~ns (for the water phase) to the total number of hits.


\item[$\bullet$] $\beta_{14}$ isotropy classifier

This classifier uses Legendre polynomials to return the	first ($\beta_1$) and the fourth ($\beta_4$) spherical	harmonics of an event, where:
\[
\beta_l = \frac{2}{N(N-1)}\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^N P_l(\cos\theta_{ij})
\]
and $P_l(\cos\theta_{ij})$ are Legendre polynomials.


The	combination	of these two polynomials returned by the classifier	was	
practically	chosen by the SNO collaboration	to be: $\beta_{14}=\beta_1+4\beta_4$
as	this gives	something that looks kinda gaussian-like	for	Cherenkov	events.	
Essentially	any	deviation from zero suggests some polarity (i.e. the event is not isotropic).	


\item[$\bullet$] $\theta_{ij}$ isotropy classifier 

describes the angle subtended at an event vertex by PMT \#i and PMT \#j.

\[
\cos\theta_{ij}=\frac{(\vec{X}_{PMT\#i}- \vec{X}_{event})\cdot (\vec{X}_{PMT\#j}- \vec{X}_{event})}{|\vec{X}_{PMT\#i}- \vec{X}_{event}||\vec{X}_{PMT\#j}- \vec{X}_{event}|}
\]
\end{itemize}

The output values were used for distinguishing the signal from backgrounds.

In SNO+ water phase, solar $\nu_e$s are basically measured via elastic scattering $\nu_e+e^-\to \nu_e+e^-$. The maximum kinetic energy of the recoil electron is
$T_{max}=\frac{2E^2_\nu}{2E_\nu+m_e c^2}$
the cross section is $\sigma(\nu_e+e^-\to \nu_e+e^-)=9.52\times 10^{-44}(E_\nu/10~MeV)~cm^2$
the expected solar neutrino rate is 
$R=A\int_{T_{thresh}}^{T_{max}}\frac{d\sigma}{dE}\frac{dN}{dE_\nu}dE_\nu$.

A ``solar angle'', $\theta_{sun}$ is the direction of the event relative to the Sun's location,
$\cos\theta_{sun}\equiv \vec u_{event}\cdot (\vec{X}_{event}-\vec{X}_{sun})$, where $\vec{X}_{event}-\vec{X}_{sun}$ can be replaced by the Sun's location relative to the SNOLAB location since the whole lab can be treated as a point regarding the long distance to the Sun.


\subsection{TMVA Analysis}

The Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis with ROOT (TMVA) \cite{tmvaWebsite,albertsson2007tmva}

Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) method is used for the multiple variable analysis (MVA).

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve describes the signal/background binary classifier system.

The MC simulations of the realistic runs (200004 to 207718) were used.
Different types of the simulations were merged into a mixed dataset. The simulated solar $\nu_e$ events are tagged as signals and mixed with $^{214}$Bi and $^{208}$Tl background events. The total dataset was divided into training and testing sets. Table.~\ref{table:mixed_MC} summarizes the types of simulations.

Other packages developed for high energy particle physics, such as StatPatternRecognition (SPR)\cite{sprWebsite}, can be considered as an alternative tool or as a reference for results comparisons. 

\subsection{Likelihood Fits for Solar Neutrino Candidate Events}
The optimized cuts obtained from the TMVA analysis from the previous section were applied on the dataset. 

After the event selections, a distribution of $\cos\theta_{sun}$ extracted from the solar $\nu_e$ candidate events was obtained. 

\subsubsection{Maximum Likelihood Fit}
A maximum likelihood method was applied on the distribution to extract the number of the solar $\nu_e$ events ($N_{sig}$) as well as the number of the background events ($N_{bkg}$).

The values of $\cos\theta_{sun}$ from the selected events were filled into a histogram divided into bins.
For each bin, the observed event number ($n_{obs}$) was considered as a sum of solar $\nu_e$ and background events. The $n_{obs}$ in each bin was assumed to follow a Poisson distribution: $Poisson(n_{obs}, N_{bkg}\cdot P_{bkg}+N_{sig}\cdot P_{ES}(E))$, where $P_{bkg}$ and $P_{ES}(E)$ are the assumed distribution of backgrounds and solar $\nu_e$ events respectively.

Uniform distributions for the backgrounds were assumed, i.e., the $\cos\theta_{sun}$ distributions of background events were flat. In the other hand, the $\cos\theta_{sun}$ distribution of solar $\nu_e$ was extracted from the realistic simulations after applying the optimized cuts, as shown in Fig.~\ref{solarPDF}. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{solarPDF.png}
	\caption{The $\cos\theta_{sun}$ distribution of solar $\nu_e$ extracted from the simulations, which was used as a pdf function.}
	\label{solarPDF}
\end{figure}

Adding up each bin $i$ and taking $N_{bkg}$ and $N_{sig}$ as fit parameters, the maximum likelihood function was built as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:solar_poissonFit}
-\ln\mathcal L(N_{signal},N_{bkg}|n_{obs})
=-\sum_i\ln(Poisson(n^i_{obs}, N_{bkg}P^i_{bkg}+N_{sig}P^i_{ES}(E^i))),
\end{equation}

By fitting the \ref{eq:solar_poissonFit} to the data, $N_{bkg}$ and $N_{sig}$ were obtained.
Fig.~\ref{solarFits1} shows the fit results. The fitted number of solar $\nu_e$ events is $N_{sig} = 67.1\pm9.2$, which is equivalent to a rate of $1.04\pm 0.14~event/(day\cdot kiloton)$; while the fitted number of background events is $N_{sig} = 3.4\pm0.91$, which is equivalent to a rate of $0.05\pm 0.01 event/(day\cdot kiloton)$.
