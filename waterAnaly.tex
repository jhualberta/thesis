The SNO+ water data taking from May 2017 to September 2018. The period from May 2017 to October 2018 is the first stage of the water phase. During this stage, several calibration runs were taken, including the $^{16}$N calibration scans and the laserball scans. During the period from October 2018 to July 2019, over 20 tonnes of LAB (without PPO) was filled into the detector and the liquid mostly occupied the neck volume, slightly below the neck bottom. With the nitrogen cover gas on the top, the data taken during this period is considered as low background data.


The open dataset 100000 to 100399, from 4 to 14 May 2017.


\section{High Level Cuts: Classifiers}

A set of classifiers have been developed since the SNO analysis and been optimized for the SNO+ data \cite{highlevel}.


\begin{itemize}

\item[$\bullet$] In time ratio (ITR) classifier

This classifier calculates the ratio of the number of hits in an optimized prompt time window ([-2.5,5.0]~ns for the water phase) to the total number of hits.


\item[$\bullet$] $\beta_{14}$ isotropy classifier

This classifier uses Legendre polynomials to return the	first ($\beta_1$) and the fourth ($\beta_4$) spherical	harmonics of an event, where:
\[
\beta_l = \frac{2}{N(N-1)}\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^N P_l(\cos\theta_{ij})
\]
and $P_l(\cos\theta_{ij})$ are Legendre polynomials.

The	combination	of these two polynomials returned by the classifier	was	
practically	chosen by the SNO collaboration	to be: $\beta_{14}=\beta_1+4\beta_4$
as	this gives	something	that	looks	kinda gaussian-like	for	Cerenkov	events.	
Essentially	any	deviation	from	zero	suggests	some	polarity	(i.e.	the	event	is	not	
isotropic).	



\item[$\bullet$] $\theta_{ij}$ isotropy classifier 

describes the angle subtended at an event vertex by PMT \#i and PMT \#j.

\[
\cos\theta_{ij}=\frac{(\vec{X}_{PMT\#i}- \vec{X}_{event})\cdot (\vec{X}_{PMT\#j}- \vec{X}_{event})}{|\vec{X}_{PMT\#i}- \vec{X}_{event}||\vec{X}_{PMT\#j}- \vec{X}_{event}|}
\]
\end{itemize}


\section{\isotope[16]{N} Calibration Scans in the Water Phase}
During the water phase, an Nitrogen-16 ($^{16}$N) calibration source was deployed for internal detector calibration scans in June and November, 2017 and external detector scans in March, 2018.

The $^{16}$N calibration runs provide an ideal test of fitter performance. From a comparison of reconstructions for data and MC, we can also extract the resolution and bias of the fitter. Here I worked out the vertex and the direction reconstruction performances for both of the RAT water fitter and the MPW. The vertex shifts as well as the uncertainties are evaluated. 

The $\gamma$-rays emitted from the $^{16}$N source interact with the water in the detector mainly via Compton scattering. Figure~\ref{hsx} shows the spatial distributions of the first $\gamma$-ray interaction positions projected on the x axis (called spatial distribution $S(x)$) obtained from MC simulation. The $^{16}$N source is considered as an electron source with a known spatial distribution\cite{boulay2004direct}. For simplicity, in the following we always discuss the $x$ component of the position vector $\vec{X}$. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\includegraphics[width=9cm]{sx.pdf}
	\caption{Spatial distributions of {$^{16}$}N first $\gamma$-rays interaction position projected on x axis, obtained from RAT simulations. The double-peak structure is due to the wall of the stainless steel container of the $^{16}N$ source.}
	\label{hsx}
\end{figure}

A position resolution function is defined for the reconstructed electron position distribution\cite{boulay2004direct}:
\[
R(x)=\frac{1-\alpha_e}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_p}\exp{[-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu_p}{\sigma_p})^2]+\frac{\alpha_e}{2\tau_p}\exp{[\frac{-|x-\mu_p|}{\tau_p}]}},
\]
where $\alpha_e$ is the fractional exponential component, $\sigma_p$ is
the Gaussian width (corresponding to the position resolution), $\mu_p$ is the Gaussian shift  (corresponding to the position bias) and $\tau_p$ is the exponential slope (corresponding to the position distributions in tails).

For electrons from the $^{16}$N calibration source, their spatial distribution function $N_{R}(x)$ can be described by the position resolution function smeared by the convolution of $S(x)$ as\cite{boulay2004direct}:
\[
N_{R}(x)=\int^{+\infty}_{-\infty} S(x)R(x_{fit}-x)dx.
\]

Since the $S(x)$ and $N_{R}(x)$ are histograms obtained from the data and MC, we calculate by the bin value $x_i$: 
\[N_R(x_i)=\sum_{x_i=-\infty}^{+\infty}S(x_i)R(x_{fit}^i-x_i).\].

The $\chi^2$ is calculated by:
\[
\chi^2=\sum^{N_{bins}}_{i=0}[\frac{N_R(x_{fit}^i)-N_R^{fit}(x_{fit}^i)}{\sigma_i}]^2,
\]
where $N_R^{fit}$ is a trial fit to the $N_R$ by tuning the $\{\alpha_e,\mu_p,\sigma_p,\tau_p\}$ and $\sigma_i$ is taken as the bin width of the histograms.

By minimizing the $\chi^2$, the parameters of the resolution function, $\{\alpha_e,\mu_p,\sigma_p,\tau_p\}$ and a best $N_R^{fit}$ are obtained.

Fig.~\ref{posresol} shows a comparison of the reconstructed x position of {$^{16}$}N events between data and MC. The reconstructed position distributions are fitted with $N_R^{fit}$.

\subsection{Angular Resolution}
An angular resolution function was 

It is defined as a combination of two exponential components:
\begin{equation}
P(\cos\theta)=\alpha_M\frac{\beta_M\exp[-\beta_M(1-\cos\theta)]}{1-\exp(-2\beta_M)}+(1-\alpha_M)\frac{\beta_s\exp[-\beta_s(1-\cos\theta)]}{1-\exp(-2\beta_s)},
\end{equation}
where the parameters: $\beta_M$ and $\beta_S$ are the ``decay'' constants or ``slopes'' of the two exponential components; the $\alpha_M$ is the fraction between two exponential components.
events following the exponential with slope βm. 


The angle θ is the displacement between the ‘truth’ and
reconstructed directions.

Direction resolutions, with a cut of $|\vec{X}_{fit}-\vec{X}_{src,manip}|>1.5~m$:

The fitted results are shown in Table.~\ref{angularResolValues}.

	\end{tabular}
	\label{angularResolValues}
\end{table}


Fig.~\ref{angularResolMPW} shows the fits of the angular distributions after $|\vec{X}_{fit}-\vec{X}_{src,manip}|>1.5~m$ cuts.

To describe the $\cos\theta_e$ distribution, the angles that contain 50\%, 80\%
and 90\% of the reconstructed events, the $\cos\theta_{0.5}$, $\cos\theta_{0.8}$ and $\cos\theta_{0.9}$ can also be used. Their values are solved numerically by the equation \ref{eq:cosTheta_e} below (take $\cos\theta_{0.5}$ as an example):

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cosTheta_e}
\frac{\int_{\cos\theta_{0.5}}^1 P(\cos\theta_e) d\cos\theta_e}{\int_{-1}^1 P(\cos\theta_e) d\cos\theta_e} = 50\%,
\end{equation}

where $P(\cos\theta_e)$ is the direction resolution function with the best fitted parameters. If these values are large, the $\cos\theta_e$ distribution is sharper and more peaked around +1.
